1. Goal Identification: The goal behind this project is to design
	and implement a social media website which is based upon
	three core principles: user data privacy, free speech, and simplicity of design.
	Website's primary use is to connect friends and family. No social engineering, corrective algorithms,
	tampering, or intrusive monitoring. Straightforward News Feeds are generated
	in unaltered chronological sequence of times that friends/pages posts were actually
	posted.
