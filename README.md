# PostPrivate

I am currently developing this social media application. It's just like Facebook and Twitter, 
just without all the deranking and deplatforming of users and content that they don't agree with.

The platform also focuses on User Privacy (no constant collection, analyzation, and selling of user data). 
There is also a focus on User Privacy, and simplicity of design.

This web application is currently being built on ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.
